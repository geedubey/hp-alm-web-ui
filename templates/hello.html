              <h1>Hi, team!</h1>
              <p>This app was inspired by the need to quickly view and edit defects in our internal HP ALM instance.</p>
              <p>No, you can't edit defects (yet).</p>
              <p>It is meant to be highly tailored to our needs.</p>
              <p> It is largely experimental and needs some dirty workarounds to work
              (like the cross origin extension you've installed).</p>
            </div>
